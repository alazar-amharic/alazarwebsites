        <h2>Teeth Health: How to Protect Your Teeth</h2>
        <p>Good oral hygiene is crucial for maintaining healthy teeth and gums. It involves more than just brushing twice a day; it requires a comprehensive approach to prevent tooth decay and gum disease.</p>
        <p>First, brushing your teeth properly with fluoride toothpaste is essential. Fluoride helps to strengthen tooth enamel and prevent cavities. Brush for at least two minutes, covering all surfaces of your teeth, including the front, back, and chewing surfaces.</p>
        <p>Flossing is another critical step. It removes plaque and food particles from between your teeth and under the gumline, areas that a toothbrush can't reach. Daily flossing helps prevent gum disease and cavities.</p>
        <p>Avoiding sugary snacks and drinks is also vital. Sugar feeds the harmful bacteria in your mouth, leading to plaque formation and tooth decay. Instead, opt for healthy snacks like fruits, vegetables, and dairy products.</p>
        <p>Regular dental check-ups are necessary for maintaining oral health. Your dentist can detect early signs of tooth decay, gum disease, and other oral health issues. Professional cleanings remove tartar, a hardened form of plaque that regular brushing can't remove.</p>
        <p>In addition to these habits, using a mouthwash can help reduce bacteria and freshen your breath. Choose a mouthwash with fluoride for added protection against cavities.</p>
        <p>Finally, avoid smoking or using tobacco products. Tobacco use is a significant risk factor for gum disease and oral cancer. Quitting smoking can dramatically improve your oral health and overall well-being.</p>

        <p id="teeth-more" style="display: none;">A balanced diet is also crucial for healthy teeth. Foods rich in calcium, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, help strengthen your teeth. Vitamin D, found in eggs and fatty fish, aids in calcium absorption. Additionally, crunchy fruits and vegetables like apples and carrots stimulate saliva production, which helps wash away food particles and neutralize acids in your mouth.</p>

        <h2>Ethiopia's Economy</h2>
        <p>Ethiopia is one of the largest and most populous countries in Africa, with a diverse economy that has seen rapid growth over the past decade. The government has implemented several reforms to modernize the economy, improve infrastructure, and attract foreign investment.</p>
        <p>The agriculture sector remains the backbone of Ethiopia's economy, employing around 70% of the workforce. Coffee is the country's most significant export, followed by other agricultural products like flowers, oilseeds, and livestock. The government has prioritized agricultural modernization to increase productivity and food security.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the manufacturing sector has emerged as a vital contributor to economic growth. Ethiopia is becoming a hub for textile and garment production, attracting major international brands. The government has established industrial parks across the country to promote manufacturing and export-oriented industries.</p>
        <p>Infrastructure development is another key focus. Significant investments have been made in transportation, energy, and telecommunications. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), once completed, is expected to generate significant hydroelectric power, contributing to the country's energy needs and boosting industrialization.</p>
        <p>The services sector, including tourism, telecommunications, and financial services, is also expanding rapidly. Ethiopia's rich cultural heritage, historical sites, and natural landscapes make it an attractive destination for tourists. The government is working to develop the tourism infrastructure to accommodate the growing number of visitors.</p>
        <button onclick="showMore('ethiopia')">Learn More</button>
        <p id="ethiopia-more" style="display: none;">Despite these positive developments, Ethiopia faces several challenges. Poverty remains widespread, and income inequality is growing. The country is also vulnerable to external shocks, such as fluctuating commodity prices and climate change impacts, including droughts and floods.</p>
        <p>The government is committed to addressing these challenges through its Growth and Transformation Plans (GTPs). These plans aim to achieve middle-income status by 2025 by promoting sustainable development, improving education and healthcare, and reducing poverty. However, political stability and social cohesion are critical for achieving these goals, and the government must work to resolve ongoing ethnic tensions and conflicts.</p>

        <h2>Business Insights</h2>
        <p>In the rapidly changing global economy, businesses must adapt to new trends and technologies to stay competitive. One of the most significant shifts is the rise of digital transformation, which is reshaping industries and creating new opportunities.</p>
        <p>Digital transformation involves integrating digital technologies into all areas of a business, fundamentally changing how companies operate and deliver value to customers. This includes adopting cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
        <p>Cloud computing allows businesses to access computing resources and services over the internet, reducing the need for expensive on-premises infrastructure. It enables scalability, flexibility, and cost savings, making it an essential tool for businesses of all sizes.</p>
        <p>AI and machine learning are revolutionizing industries by automating processes, enhancing decision-making, and improving customer experiences. Businesses use AI for everything from chatbots and personalized marketing to predictive analytics and supply chain optimization.</p>
        <p>Big data analytics helps businesses make informed decisions by analyzing large volumes of data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. Companies can use this information to optimize operations, improve products and services, and tailor marketing strategies to specific customer segments.</p>
        <p>The IoT connects devices and systems, allowing them to communicate and share data. This technology is transforming industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics by enabling real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and enhanced efficiency.</p>
        <button onclick="showMore('business')">Learn More</button>
        <p id="business-more" style="display: none;">Sustainability is another critical area of focus for businesses. Consumers and investors are increasingly demanding that companies take responsibility for their environmental and social impacts. Businesses are adopting sustainable practices, such as reducing carbon emissions, minimizing waste, and sourcing materials responsibly.</p>
        <p>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is also becoming more important. Companies are expected to contribute positively to society, whether through charitable initiatives, ethical business practices, or promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. A strong CSR program can enhance a company's reputation, attract customers, and improve employee engagement.</p>
        <p>Finally, customer experience is at the heart of business success. Companies that prioritize customer satisfaction and build strong relationships with their customers are more likely to thrive. This involves understanding customer needs, providing excellent service, and delivering high-quality products.</p>
        <p>Businesses must also embrace innovation and be willing to adapt to changing market conditions. This includes staying ahead of industry trends, investing in research and development, and fostering a culture of creativity and continuous improvement. By doing so, companies can maintain a competitive edge and drive long-term growth.</p>
